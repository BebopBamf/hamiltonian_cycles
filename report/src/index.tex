Let us write a nice intro here.

\section{The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem}

\subsection{Description}

The hamiltonian cycle is similar to that of the hamiltonian path where inside an
undirected or directed graph, the hamiltonian path, also known as the traceable
path, is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. However, differing to the
hamiltonian path, the starting point and ending point of the path must also be
adjacent to each other such that they are able to create a cycle using an
available edge. 

The hamiltonian cycle problem can be expressed in many ways depending on whether
you represent it as a decision problem (does a graph contain a hamiltonian
cycle, yes or no?) or whether the algorithm should return the actual path.
